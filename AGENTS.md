# interface-api

The AntelopeJS interface for HTTP and WebSocket APIs, published as `@antelopejs/interface-api`. The contract is exported from the package root, `src/index.ts`; there are no subpaths. The declarations live in private modules under `src/`, and `src/index.ts` re-exports them: types with `export type`, runtime values with `export import`, which keeps each export a writable data property. The order of those lines is the published key order of the CommonJS exports: keep it and append new exports at the end. `src/proxies.ts` creates every proxy the implementation binds, in their published order. The HTTP server is in the implementing module, `@antelopejs/api`, not here.

## Versioning of @antelopejs/interface-core

`@antelopejs/interface-core` is a peer dependency, and the devDependency uses the same range. The README compatibility table carries a `docs-compat` marker that the CI docs check compares with `peerDependencies`, so change the range and the table together.

## Tests

- `pnpm test` builds `dist`, then `ajs module test .` reads `src/antelope.test.ts` (`antelopeJs.test` in package.json) and runs the compiled suites in `dist/tests` against `@antelopejs/api` 1.3.0, a devDependency loaded as a local module. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` overrides its `@antelopejs/interface-api` dependency with a link to this package, so the suites exercise the local build: without the override they would test the published copy the api module installs. Port 5010 on 127.0.0.1 must be free.
- The suites live in `src/tests/`, not `src/test/`, so `knip.config.ts` lists them as entries.
- The suites import the contract from `../index`, never from `@antelopejs/interface-api`: the package name resolves to the installed published copy unless a self-link exists, and `antelopejs/no-self-import-in-tests` rejects it.
- The compiled suites ship in `dist/tests` and also run from implementation modules (`antelopeJs.implements`), where the core resolver hands out facades for every passed value: assert behaviour and structure, never reference identity.
- `route-lifecycle.test.ts` replaces the register and unregister callbacks of `routesProxy` with a recording provider in its `before` hook, so the cases assert what reaches the registry. The controllers of the other suites register when the files load, before any hook runs, so the api module already serves their routes; a suite that registers routes later would not be served once that hook has run.
- `pnpm run checks` does not run the documentation check. CI runs it through `AntelopeJS/tooling-configs/actions/docs` on `README.md` and `docs/`, and type-checks the `docs-check` fences against `docs/tsconfig.json`. To run it locally, check out `AntelopeJS/tooling-configs` at the commit `ci-node.yml` pins, run `npm ci --prefix actions/docs --omit=dev`, then from this repository run `node <checkout>/actions/docs/check.mjs --files "$(printf 'README.md\ndocs')" --typescript-project docs/tsconfig.json`.

## Shipped files

- `skills/` ships in the npm package and reaches users through `antelopeJs.skills`. When a change alters the public API, update `skills/api-interface/SKILL.md`.
- `docs/` ships too, and is the source of interfaces.antelopejs.com/docs/api.

## Guardrails

Finish every change with `pnpm run checks`. It runs typecheck, lint, format, knip, tests, size, ratchet, suppressions, and sync, and prints only what failed. The change is done when it prints no failure.

The tools enforce most rules, listed in the table at the end. The sections below hold the rules no tool checks.

### Comments

Say it in code. A constraint belongs in a type, a lint rule, or a test. A public item's contract belongs in TSDoc (`/** */`) on that item. The only other comments are lint directives that name their rules, `@ts-expect-error <reason>`, `SAFETY: <reason>` above a type assertion, `/*!` license headers, and bundler or formatter directives.

Before suppressing a type rule, try inference or a type derived from its owner with `Parameters`, `ReturnType`, or indexed access. A private alias can still appear in a published declaration. Keep a suppression only after checking the published contract and the unchecked boundary it protects.

Check each directive reason against the current line and its callers. Returning a value is not the same as awaiting and discarding it. A reason must describe what the code does now.

### Tests

Hold every test you write or keep to this checklist:

- Name the wrong implementation this test fails on. A test with no answer is deleted, not kept.
- No test reads the file it tests. Drive the behaviour through the public interface.
- An invariant over many files is a lint rule, not a test.

### Cleanup proof

A behaviour-preserving cleanup PR shows `antelopejs-api-diff <base-ref>` passing. Published declarations, built runtime exports and the names and signatures a DMS frontend module auto-imports stay unchanged; pass `--allow-added <glob>` (repeatable, e.g. `'**/internal/**'`) to let added entries under that glob pass when their module is `@internal`, and copy its "Added (allowed)" list. Every export under a directory that `dms.frontend.build.ts` auto-imports is published, `@internal` or not; a helper that must stay private goes under `app/build/`. A comment-only PR shows `antelopejs-comment-proof <base-ref>` passing instead of a verifier. Both compare committed HEAD.

Copy the proof's whole output into the PR body, down to its closing `<!-- antelopejs-proof ... -->` line, which stamps the command, base, committed head and a digest. Never type counts by hand. List the lint findings a PR leaves in place by pasting the block `antelopejs-body-check --findings` prints and replacing each `<why>`. `antelopejs-body-check <body.md>` fails an edited or stale proof block, proof output outside one, and a findings line that is not a live diagnostic at HEAD; counts in prose are not checked, so leave them out. The table counts a lint directive once per rule it names, inline directives included.

Pass `--probe <file.cjs>` to api-diff when changing receivers, positional calls, or modules that no published entry reaches. The same captured script runs against both worktree roots, supplied as `argv[2]`, and prints JSON observations. Matching metadata alone does not prove those behaviours.

An entry-only rule exempts only its own module. Add a second module entry rather than exempting another importer. A no-upward rule must reject peers in the same tier as well as higher tiers. Probe the rank decision with an import, not just a reading of the configuration.

Moving a method body into a function keeps how it is called: the same receiver, argument count, read order and laziness.

Verify a boundary against the imports a developer or agent would plausibly write: static and dynamic imports, re-exports, Vue `src`, CSS `@import`, and worker or child-process entries in normally named files. A construction only an evasion would write, an edit to resolution configuration (`package.json` `browser`, `exports`, `main` or `imports`, bundler aliases, tsconfig `paths`), and a difference observable only by patching private fields or internal methods go under Attention and never block. Public API and ordinary subclass behaviour stay part of the contract.

### Suppression budget

`guardrails.suppressions.json` caps the suppressions in authored code: lint directives per rule they name (`*` for none), `@ts-expect-error`, `@ts-ignore` and `SAFETY:` comments, and under `config` each rule a lint config (`oxlint.config.*`, `.oxlintrc.json`, `eslint.config.*`) switches off or to a warning, keyed by rule and `files` glob anchored at the config's directory, so widening or moving a scope is a new ceiling of 0, while narrowing one takes over the room it gives up. Switching a rule off in a config is a suppression too: fix the code its rule reports instead. A suppression over its ceiling fails: fix the code, or remove another suppression of the same kind. A rule that keeps needing suppressions should be changed in the preset. Never raise or remove a number in that file: the check fails a ceiling higher than on the pull request base, and only the operator approves a raise. A directive disabling `anti-slop/require-safety-comment-for-type-assertion` is burn-down debt: remove the assertion, or, where it holds, replace the directive with `SAFETY: <why it holds>`, which takes over its room without a raise. After you remove suppressions, run `pnpm run suppressions:update` and commit the lowered file.

### Debt

`guardrails.ratchet.json` records the lint findings and oversize files this repository already had. Its numbers only go down. After you remove debt, or after a pack upgrade, run `pnpm run ratchet:update` and commit the file: it lowers the numbers and adds only the rules the new pack release enabled, at today's count. Never edit the numbers by hand; CI fails one added or raised against the base. A rule listed there is off for `oxlint`. The ratchet counts it instead, and the pre-commit hook rejects it on every line you add.
